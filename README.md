Educational Directory GUI
=========================

Learning GUI project done with [MaxGoo](https://github.com/MaxGoo)

Class project aimed at teaching basic GUIs. Project draws a GUI which can be used to store different levels of personal information for three types of people: Person, Student, and Grad Student. Programmed using the swing library and absolute positioning to draw the GUI. Uses a text file to store the information between launches.

Things I would do differently:
 * Uses a layout manager to make a more robust GUI which can more easily be changed
 * Don't use text file to store information, rather save the objects to .xml
